Hello I'm Harry, a fourth year Master of Physics student at The University of Manchester.
I am fluent in Python, C++, HTML and CSS with an advanced knowledge of popular Python modules such as numpy, matplotlib and pandas.
I primarily use coding for data analysis but I have also made some interesting projects in both C++ and Python.
