# <p align="center">Harry Tabb's Github</p>

Hello I'm Harry, a graduate from The University of Manchester with a Master of Physics degree with Honours.
I am fluent in Python, C++, HTML and CSS with an advanced knowledge of popular Python modules such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn and pytorch.
My master's project was done in collaboration with City Football Group to investigate the effectiveness of using Neural Networks to model footballing tactics. 
I primarily use coding for data analysis but I have also made some interesting projects in both C++ and Python.
Please note that this page is a work in progress and I am in the process of uploading files so some documents are incomplete.

## Physics Undergraduate Lab Experiments
Below is a complete list of all lab experiments that I conducted in my 4 years at The University of Manchester. These were all done in collaboration with my lab partner. \
Each experiment has a handwritten lab notebook which I used for rough notetaking during the experiment. These were only meant for rough notes, but I have included them as they give a good overview of the experiments.\
Most experiments also have a typed lab report which give a more official summary of the experiment. These are all written in the house academic style.\
I also presented the results from the experiments through in-person interviews either alone or as a duo. These ranged from 30 minutes in Year 1 to multiple hour long presentations in Year 4.

## Note
Most of the lab notebook pdf files struggle to load images when viewed in github, for full access please download the files to view.

## University Coding Projects
Below is a complete list of the coding projects that I completed during my 4 years at The University of Manchester. It is worth noting that this does not include the coding work used for lab experiments, this is all included above.  These projects focused on simulation, data analysis methods and making interfaces and used C++, Python and Jupyter notebooks. 

### C++
* Stellar Catalogue
* Class hierarchy for shapes
* Creating a matrix interface
* Creating a complex number interface
* Galaxy Classification
* Data Sorting
* Bohr Atom Energy

### Python
* Simulating neutron penetration with Monte Carlo techniques
* Investigating numerical integration methods
* Data analysis on the different spreading laws for fluids
* Data analysis on the Breit-Wigner distribution
* Simulating a bouncing ball
